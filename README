This repository is useless to other people. It is a project for me to
learn how to use GNU Autotools in an emacs environment.

* What I did to make this project:
  1. I made hello.c
     
     hello.c:
     #+begin_src c
       #include <stdio.h>

       int main()
       {
	 printf("Hello world\n");
	 return 0;
       }
     #+end_src

  2. I made configure.ac
     
     configure.ac
     #+begin_src m4
       # Autoconf requirements
       # Initialize, but use more options. Note parameters brackets and whitespace.
       AC_INIT([hello], [0.01], [dwheeler@dwheeler.com],
				       [hello], [http://www.dwheeler.com])
       #Force autoconf to be at least this version number:
       AC_PREREQ([2.68])

       #Safety Check - list a source file that wouldn't be in other directories:
       AC_CONFIG_SRCDIR([hello.c])

       # Put config results here, so we can easily #include them:
       AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])

       # Put autotools aux files in subdir to reduce clutter:
       AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([build-aux])

       # Enable "automake" to simplify creating Makefiles
       AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([1.11 -Wall -Werror])
       AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])

       # Look for a C compiler:
       AC_PROG_CC

       # Its possible to check for: more programs, libraries, header files, types, structures, compiler characteristics, library functions, system services.

       # Final output
       AC_OUTPUT
     #+end_src

  3. I made Makefile.am
     #+begin_src m4
       bin_PROGRAMS = hello
       hello_SOURCES = hello.c
     #+end_src

  4. I created some file that autoreconf needs in order to auto
     configure stuff.

     #+begin_src bash
       list="AUTHORS ChangeLog COPYING INSTALL NEWS README"
       touch $list
     #+end_src

* Using this project to learn Autotools
** Things to learn
*** What is staged and unstaged
*** Editing files quickly
    How can I get the files I want to
    change to show up in the
    magit-status page so that I can
    change them by pressing enter and
    editing it. This way I dont have to
